Welcome to the underwater adventure of superresolution! If you've ever wanted to see underwater objects in all their high-definition glory without the need for high-resolution labels, you're in the right place.

## üåä What's This About?
This repository holds the code for our work on **LLM-Driven Unsupervised Genetic Learning for Underwater Imaging**. It's as cool as it sounds. Dive in to explore how large language models can help us achieve object superresolution in underwater images.

## üé¨ Demo Time!
### Demo Images
Witness the magic of our method as it enhances underwater images to superresolution levels‚Äîwithout needing ground truth labels. The white arrow highlights the unclear shape of rocks in both the raw image and the processed image from traditional GAN models (including the Diffusion Model). Our method consistently finds the optimal solution tailored to the specific underwater environment. The yellow rectangle indicates the improved signal-to-noise ratio from generation 21 to the end.
